# Koji's Pixel Art Maker

I created this dynamic JavaScript web app for my Nanodegree at Udacity.
Starter HTML, CSS code, (and an empty JS file) were provided. 
The main challenge was to create a .js file that would: 
 (1) create a grid dynamically with JavaScript by inserting columns and rows into the HTML <table> element based on the user selected dimensions.
 (2) add interactivity (event listeners) so that a user can use any color to color cells in the grid by clicking on them.
 (3) allow the user to reset the grid when clicking the Submit button again.
