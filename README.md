# Koji's Pixel Art Maker

I created this dynamic JavaScript web app for my Nanodegree at Udacity. Starter HTML, CSS code, (and an empty JS file) were provided by Udacity. The main challenge was to create a .js file that would: 

(1) create a grid dynamically with JavaScript by inserting columns and rows into the HTML <table> 
 element based on the user selected dimensions.
 
(2) add interactivity (event listeners) so that a user can use any color to color cells in the 
 grid by clicking on them.
 
(3) allow the user to reset the grid when clicking the Submit button again.

For the starter files provided by Udacity, visit the following GitHub repository:

FOR WINDOWS:\
Extract the cloned zip file.\
Double click the index.html file. (This should run automatically via your default browser because browsers contain JavaScript engines!\
Feel free to change the dimensions (height and width) of your desired grid.\
Feel free to change the color picker as you desire.\
If you wish to reset the entire grid, you can either refresh the webpage Ctrl + R, \or simply click the 'Submit' button again, which will generate an empty grid of the dimensions specified!\
Enjoy!
